Perform z-Score-Transformation on every channel of BGR color space including max and median
***
This script takes the preprocessed image data and extracts some features.
Input is a folder with image files. The images are colored.
Output is a CSV file with image features.
The features extracted here are indicator values from the histograms for every channel of BGR color space.
Color features are being extracted using OpenCV
***
Resize images to 500 x 500 pixels AND convert to RGB color space.
